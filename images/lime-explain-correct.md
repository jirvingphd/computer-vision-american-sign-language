The letters O and F in ASL are indeed similar, as both involve the fingers forming a loop. However, they have distinct differences that can be critical for accurate classification.


- Key Similarities:
    - Both letters involve forming a loop with the fingers.
    - Both have a circular shape as part of the sign.
- Key Differences:
    - In the letter O, all fingers and the thumb touch to form the circle, while in the letter F, only the thumb and index finger touch.
    - The remaining fingers in the letter F are extended, whereas in the letter O, they are curved and relaxed.
