### Future Work
>There are many more iterations to test for this task:
- [ ] Does image augmentation help the models?
- [ ] Does adding additional hiddden layers on top of EfficientNet improve performance
- [ ] Does allowing the transfer learning models to train the convolutional base improve performance?

> **The next level of complextiy would be to add object detection for hands, followed by sign classification.**
## Summary
This project demonstrates proof-of-concept work classifying ASL alphabetical characters. Working with a 26-label classification model is tricky, but pales in comparison to what would be required to interpert whole ASL words.
